muon extraction from electrons

electron can fit nicely to actual electron 21037101 7

properly split 21437101 38


maybe make first set of chains, find the electron to get a vertex... and then make the rest of the chains
and also be able to use the vertex from the pmf as a guess!



chain extension on all found chains, starting with largest/longest first

primary electron needs to be done over a chain path , not just a single chain
